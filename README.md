# 🚀 Boost Seller Demo – Product Finding Application for Dropshipping
One of the biggest challenges for dropshippers is:
Finding the right product and performing accurate price analysis.

I developed an idea that could solve this problem and turned it into a demo application.
This application, which I developed with mock data during my Flutter learning process, demonstrates the technical feasibility of the idea.

##📦 New Update!  
🔧 The price, rating, and sales volume of each product can now be defined independently across different stores.  
📊 Unique pricing and performance data have been defined for each store.  
🧹 The app’s code structure has been reworked and aligned with clean code principles.  

## 🧠 Key Features:
✅ Products are listed by category and stores where they are sold (e.g., Babazon, Trendway, xBay...)
✅ Multiple suppliers and supply prices can be defined for each product
✅ Net profit/loss analysis is performed by comparing the sales price with the supply price
✅ A 10% commission difference is automatically included in the calculation
✅ State management implemented with GetX
✅ Clean code, modular structure, and commented functions

## 🎯 My vision:
📡 Transform this project into an application that works with real data by accessing APIs from platforms such as Amazon, Trendyol, and Temu
🤝 Offer the resulting infrastructure as an integrable solution to companies in need
